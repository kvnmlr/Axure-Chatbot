# Axure Chatbot
*Template and sample of a functional chat bot implementation in Axure RP8*
***
Axure RP is a wireframing and rapid prototyping tool. It allows for the creation of **fast high fidelity prototypes** to test applications and gain feedback from users. Many modern apps have a direct messaging functionality or the possibility to interact with an AI using a conversation-like interaction style. Prototyping such functionality with the given built-in features is probably either not feasible or will lead to unsatisfactory results which will not be sufficient for testing with users. 

This project presents an easy and fast way to achieve this by using external services to handle the conversational nature of the interaction such that we can focus on design decisions within out wireframes.
## Purpose
Everybody who wants to prototype an app that has a large enough component that requires very dynamic conversation between the user and the system can use this project as a starting point. From there, you can build you own app from scratch or built the functionalit into an existing app by using the provided widget. You can also modify the sample app to your needs.
